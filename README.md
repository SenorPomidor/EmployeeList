# EmployeeList

This is a simple employee list editor for directors that allows you to add new employees to the list, as well as change settings and delete them. The director can only manage the employees which he has added to the list, also he can add, edit, delete tasks for employees. Employees can mark complected tasks and directors return tasks to remake.
