# EmployeeList

This is a simple list editor for directors that allows you to add new employees to the list, as well as change settings and delete them. The director can only manage the employees which he has added to the list.

-----------------

What I want to do:
* Roles of employees (DONE);
* Registration (DONE);
* Authorization (DONE);
* Add/modify/delete tasks for employees.
* ...

Current bug: forbidden 403 when changing data of employee (FIXED)
