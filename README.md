This is a simple list editor that allows you to add new workers to the list, as well as change parameters and delete them.

What I want to do:
* Roles of employees (DONE);
* Registration;
* Authorization (DONE);
* Add/modify/delete tasks for employees.
* ...

Current bug: forbidden 403 when changing data of employee (FIXED)
